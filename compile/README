Steps to compile the model. 

1. move to your build directory. This is where you will compile
   the model.
2. When in the build directory, use the get_makefile.bash 
   script to generate the makefile
   Make sure the script points to the correct source files,
   mod directory, and optfile
3. execute : make depend
4. execute : make

Notes : "make depend" this makes it so you can modify 
the files in your build directory. Then you simply
need to run "make" to recompile the model.
